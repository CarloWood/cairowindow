Let P(x) = (x + 13) * (x - 37) * (x - 127), with obvious roots

  r₀ = -13
  r₁ = 37
  r₂ = 127

  P(x) = 61087 + 2567⋅x - 151⋅x² + x³

The first derivative is:

  dP/dx = 2567 - 302⋅x + 3⋅x²

The second derivative is:

  d²P/dx² = -302 + 6⋅x

For the x-coordinate of the inflection point holds:

  P''(Ix) = 0 = -302 + 6⋅Ix -->
  Ix = 302 / 6 = 50.333333

or alternatively, Ix = -c2 / (3 * c3) = -(-151)/(3 * 1) = 151/3 = 50.333333.
Let xs = x - Ix (so that if x = Ix, then xs = 0) --> x = xs + Ix.

  f(xs) = P(xs + Ix) = 61087 + 2567⋅(xs + Ix) - 151⋅(xs + Ix)² + (xs + Ix)³
        = 61087 + 2567⋅(xs + 151/3) - 151⋅(xs + 151/3)² + (xs + 151/3)³
        = -(1748000/27) - (15100/3)⋅xs + xs³

The first derivative of that is:

  df/dxs = -15100/3 + 3⋅xs²

The extrema can be found by setting this to zero: -15100/3 + 3⋅xs² = 0 -->

  xs = +/- sqrt(15100/9) = 40.9606857581

Let xt = xs / 40.9606857581 (so that if xs = 40.9606857581, then xt = 1) --> xs = 40.9606857581⋅xt.

  g(xt) = f(40.9606857581 xt) = -(1748000/27) - (15100/3)⋅40.9606857581⋅xt + (40.9606857581⋅xt)³
        = -64740.7407407 - 206168.784982⋅xt + 68722.9283273⋅xt³

The roots of g(x) are the same as the roots of h(xt) = g(xt) / 68722.9283273 :

  h(xt) = -64740.7407407/68722.9283273 - 206168.784982/68722.9283273⋅xt + xt³ =
        = -0.94205445426 - 3⋅xt + xt³

The roots of h(xt) are:

  -0.3255
  -1.5462
   1.87171345518

Multiply with 40.9606857581 :

  -13.333333
  -63.333333
   76.666666

Next consider a cubic with just one real root:

Let P(x) = (x - (u + v⋅i)) * (x - (u - v⋅i)) * (x - 127), with obvious roots

  r₀ = u + v⋅i
  r₁ = u - v⋅i
  r₂ = 127

which is the counterpart of (x + 13) * (x - 37) * (x - 127) in
the sense that it shares the real root that is the furthest away
from the inflection point (at 50.333333), although that is now
the only real root.

Furthermore the sum of three roots are still equal:

  (u + v⋅i) + (u - v⋅i) + 127 = 2u + 127 = -13 + 37 + 127 --> u = (-13 + 37) / 2

  |(u + v⋅i) * (u - v⋅i) * 127| = |(u² + v²) 127| = |-13 * 37 * 127| -->

  u² + v² = |-13 * 37| --> v = sqrt(|-13||37| - (-13 + 37)²/4) = sqrt(481 - 144) = 18.35756

Write out (x - (u + v⋅i)) * (x - (u - v⋅i)) to get rid of the imaginary number:

  (x - (12 + v⋅i)) ⋅ (x - (12 - v⋅i)) = x² - (12 + v⋅i)⋅x - (12 - v⋅i)⋅x + (12 + v⋅i)⋅(12 - v⋅i) =
  x² - 24⋅x + 12² + v²

Thus

  P(x) = (144 + v² - 24⋅x + x²) * (x - 127) = -18288 - 127⋅v² + (3192 + v²)⋅x - 151⋅x² + x³

The first derivative is:

  dP/dx = (3192 + v²) - 302⋅x + 3⋅x²

The second derivative is:

  d²P/dx² = -302 + 6⋅x

For the x-coordinate of the inflection point holds:                        
        
  P''(Ix) = 0 = -302 + 6⋅Ix -->
  Ix = 302 / 6 = 50.333333

or alternatively, Ix = -c2 / (3 * c3) = -(-151)/(3 * 1) = 151/3 = 50.333333.
Let xs = x - Ix (so that if x = Ix, then xs = 0) --> x = xs + Ix.


  f(xs) = P(xs + Ix) = -18288 - 127⋅v² + (3192 + v²)⋅(xs + Ix) - 151⋅(xs + Ix)² + (xs + Ix)³ =
        = -18288 - 127⋅v² + (3192 + v²)⋅(xs + 151/3) - 151⋅(xs + 151/3)² + (xs + 151/3)³ =
        = -3041750/27 - (230/3)⋅v² + (-13225/3 + v²)⋅xs + xs³


  h(xt) = (-3041750/27 - (230/3)⋅v²)/k³ + (-13225/3 + v²)/k²⋅xt + xt³

where k = sqrt((-13225/3 + v²) / 3), aka

  h(xt) = (-3041750/27 - (230/3)⋅v²)/((-13225/3 + v²) / 3)^(3/2) + 3⋅xt + xt³

where v > sqrt(13225/3)

Lets just pick v = 97.16823, which results in the same scaling factor:

  df/dxs = (-13225/3 + v²) + 3⋅xs²

Setting this to zero gives:

  xs = +/- sqrt((-13225/3 + v²) / 3)

where before we had xs = +/- sqrt(15100/9) = 40.9606857581

Setting (-13225/3 + v²) / 3 = 15100/9 --> v² = (13225 + 15100)/3 = 28325/3

Thus

  P(x) = -18288 - 127⋅v² + (3192 + v²)⋅x - 151⋅x² + x³ =
       = -3652139/3 + (37901/3)⋅x - 151⋅x² + x³

Ix is still 151/3, so

  f(xs) = -3652139/3 + (37901/3)*(xs + 151/3) - 151 * (xs + 151/3)^2 + (xs + 151/3)^3 =
        = -22586000/27 + (15100/3)⋅xs + xs³

set k = sqrt((15100/3) / 3) = 40.9606857581

and define

  h(xt) = (-22586000/27)/k³ + (15100/3)/k²⋅xt + xt³ =
        = (-22586000/27)/(15100/9)^(3/2) + (15100/3)/((15100/3) / 3)⋅xt + xt³ =
        = -12.1723351853 + 3⋅xt + xt³

The root of h(xt) is:

  1.87171345518

Multiply with 40.9606857581:

   76.666666
