            <p>White has their rook on the seventh row.
            This gives an excellent opportunity to threaten to give mate in two ways at once:
            attack c7 with the white queen to threaten mate in one, and at the same time attack
            b7 or d7 to threaten mate in two.</p>

            <p>The queen can only attack these two squares (b7 and c7, or c7 and d7) by going to
            the 6th row immediately next to two or three of these squares (i.e. by going to b6, c6 or d6).</p>

            <p>While going to the 7-th row also attacks all three squares in
            front of the black king, this is often easier to defend: the white queen could be far away
            in this case giving black many opportunities to interrupt the line of attack. And defending
            just two adjacent squares of the three opposite the black king (for example b7 and c7) is
            enough to defend against the mate threat, which is easier than if the white queen is standing
            already on exactly those squares that the black queen would like to go to!
            </p>
            
            <p>In the above position, white wins by playing: 1. Qd6! threating mate in one on c7, and
            mate in two by going to d7 and then b7 (if the black queen relinquishes the defense of d7).
            For example: 1. ... Qc4 as well as 1. ... Qg3, both of which stop the mate in one, run into:
            2. Qd7+ Kb8 3. Qxb7#. Also giving the spite check 1. ... Qg1+ doesn't help because white simply
            plays 2. Nd1 with the same, renewed threat, after which black has to give up the queen to
            stop mate in two. For example, the game could continue with (best computer line)
            2. ... Qxd1+ 3. Qxd1 Bd5! (a poisoned bishop) 4. Re7 Rb8 5. c5 Rb7 6. Qxd5 Rg1+
            7. Kc2 Rxe7 8. Qa8+! Kd7 9. Qa7 Kd6 10. Qxg1 with an easy win: white rounds up all black
            pawns and then advances his pawns until black has to give up the rook.</p>
