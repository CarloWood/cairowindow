            <p>White plays and wins. Black has an exposed king and an inactive rook.
            White needs to keep black busy, or the tables could be turned due to blacks material advantage.</p>

            <p>Once white starts giving check the game is probably easily won; but as long as white can only
            keep the pressure on with threats other than a check, they must be careful not to get checks themselves,
            or white might cause lose the initiative.</p>

            <p>The <i>only</i> winning move therefore is 1. Kf1! This unpins the white rook and threatens Rg4+ with
            a swift end in favour of white. Black can't give a check that makes sense, so they play 1. ... Qh5 to stop Rg4.
            And again white only has a single winning move to win! Note there are few interesting variations
            here: 1. ... h5?! leads to a mating net: 2. Qg6+! Kh8 3. Qh6+ Kg8 4. Bd3! and the threat Qh7# is
            too strong. For example: 4. ... Re1+!? 5. Kxe1 Qc3+ 6. Ke2! (6. Kf2?? Qxd4+ and 6. Kf1 Qa1+
            7. Ke2 Re8+ 8. Kf3 Qd1+ and white can't escape infinite check: 9. Kd3 Qe1+ 10. Kf3 Qd1 etc.
            (10. Kh3?? Re3+ 11. g3? Rxg3!! hxg3 Qh1#) and 6. Kd1 Qa1+ with a similar results.) 6. ... Re8+ 7. Kf3 Qc6+
            and black had to give a rook to avoid mate by trading queens, but still loses the end game.</p>

            <p>Note that 2. h3?? loses the game to 2. ... Re6!!. while 2. ... Rd3?? loses to 2. ... Qe2+.
            The only winning move is 2. Rd5 : this renews the threat (Rg5+) while stopping black from giving
            checks. 2. ... Qg6 3. Rg5 Re6 4. Rxg6+ hxg6 5. Qg5 and white wins (5. Bxe6?? fxe6 oops).</p>
