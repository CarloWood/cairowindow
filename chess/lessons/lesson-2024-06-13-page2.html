            <h2>The fianchetto without bishop (continued)</h2>
            <p>The main difference between the previous two moves and the remaining two moves
            is that with the queen on f2 or f3, Nf5 would block the queen from going to f6
            <i>and</i> black had Qe7 as defense. Neither are possible if white goes to the d8-h4
            diagonal. For example, <span class="chess-move">1. Qh4 Nf5??</span>
            <span class="chess-move">2. Qf6</span> and again black has to give up a knight to
            stop the impending mate. E.g. <span class="chess-move">2. ... Nbd4</span>
            <span class="chess-move">3. Rxd4!</span>. Obviously black can't take the rook
            or whites bishop takes back with mate in two, but the rook is blocking the bishop,
            which gives black one extra tempo to avoid immediate mate with
            <span class="chess-move">3. ... Qe7</span>
            <span class="chess-move2">4. Qxe7 Nxe7</span>
            <span class="chess-move">5. Rd7</span> and white is a piece up.

            <p>Nevertheless, also <span class="chess-move">1. Qh4</span> isn't the winning
            move as black can now defend with <span class="chess-move">1. ... Nd6!</span> (only move)
            <span class="chess-move">2. Qf6 Nde8</span> where one knight defends g7 while
            the other blocks the white queen from going to h8! And since the white queen is attacked
            as well, he doesn't have time to threaten to sacrifice the rook on e8:
            <span class="chess-move">3. Qc3 h5!</span>
            <span class="chess-move">4. Re1 Kh7</span> and the black rook is now defending h8.</p>

            <p>This Nd6 resource does <i>not</i> work with the winning move:
            <span class="chess-move">1. Qg5!</span> (i.e.
            <span class="chess-move">1. ... Nd6</span>
            <span class="chess-move">2. Bxg7!! Ne4</span> (<span class="chess-move">2. ... Kxg7</span>
            <span class="chess-move">3. Qe5+</span> and white wins the knight)
            <span class="chess-move">3. Qh6</span> (also <span class="chess-move">3. Qe3</span>
            and <span class="chess-move">3. Qh4</span> win)
            <span class="chess-move">3. ... Nf2+</span>
            <span class="chess-move">4. Kg1 Ng4</span> (<span class="chess-move">4. ... Nxd1??</span>
            <span class="chess-move">5. Bd4</span> and mate in 3)
            <span class="chess-move">5. Qh4 Kxg7</span>
            <span class="chess-move">6. Qxg4</span> and white is again a piece up).</p>

            <p>Finally we have to look at <span class="chess-move">1. ... Ne8</span>.
            As we saw before, this isn't a good defense because it only defends f6, while
            having the white queen anywhere on the long diagonal wins. For example,
            <span class="chess-move">2. a4</span> would again win the knight as
            <span class="chess-move">2. Nd6? Qe5</span> is mate in two. But even better is
            <span class="chess-move">2. h4!</span>. Since the knight left g7, h5 is now
            deadly weakened. There is nothing black can do against the threat h4-h5-hxg7.
            Note that none of blacks pieces can move: the knight on e8 has to defend f6,
            the queen on c7 has to defend e5 and the knight on b5 can't go to d6 because
            then it blocks the queen from defending e5 (this is also why Qb8 doesn't help).
            For example what could follow is <span class="chess-move">2. ... a6?</span>
            with the idea that now at least a4 can be met with Na7.
            <span class="chess-move">3. h5 Na7</span> basically doing nothing, but what
            is white going to do? <span class="chess-move">4. hxg5 Nc8</span>
            <span class="chess-move">5. gxf7#</span>. Of course black has better, but everything
            involves sacrificing at least knight.</p>

            <p>By the way, after <span class="chess-move">1. Qg5 Ne8</span> white also
            can play <span class="chess-move">2. Ba1!</span> and then move the queen to
            b2: the only undefended square on the long diagonal. Try it out!</p>
