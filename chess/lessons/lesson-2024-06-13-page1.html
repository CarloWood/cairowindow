            <p>White plays and wins. The mating net here is having the white queen on f6,
            showing that a black knight on g7 is not a good defender: if the knight doesn't move we take
            it with mate, and if it does then it can't defend h8, thus Qh8# mate follows.</p>
            <p>Because the f-pawn is pinned, an important detail, black is unable to defend his king
            under this threat; since f7-f6 is off the table (which would use the rook on f8 to
            defend f6, block the long diagonal (a1-h8) and allow the queen to defend g7) now
            white would win with the queen <i>anywhere</i> on that long diagonal! Nevertheless,
            all but f6 is defended at the moment, so which is the correct move for white to attack it?
            He can attack f6 with the queen in four different ways:
            <span class="chess-move">1. Qf3</span>, <span class="chess-move">1. Qf2</span>,
            <span class="chess-move2">1. Qh4</span> and <span class="chess-move">1. Qg5</span>.</p>

            <p>Lets look at each move in turn. After <span class="chess-move">1. Qf3</span> black
            can defend f6 with <span class="chess-move">1. ... Qe7</span>
            (<span class="chess-move">1. ... Ne8</span> still loses to the brilliant move
            <span class="chess-move">2. a4!!</span> and black has to give up a piece because
            <span class="chess-move">2. ... Nd6</span> gives white a square on the long diagonal: 
            <span class="chess-move">3. Qc3!</span> and mate in two follows.)
            Here white can attempt to lure the black queen away with a rook sacrifice:
            <span class="chess-move">2. Rd7!? Qxd7 3. Qf6</span> but unfortunately now black has
            a check <span class="chess-move">3. ... Qd1+</span>
            <span class="chess-move">4. Bf1 Qxf1!</span> (only move)
            <span class="chess-move">5. Qxf1 Re8</span>
            <span class="chess-move">6. Kg1 (6. Qf6?? Re1+)</span>
            <span class="chess-move">6. ... Nf5</span>
            <span class="chess-move2">7. g4 Nfd4</span> blocking the bishop
            and white is only slightly better.</p>

            <p>After <span class="chess-move">1. Qf2</span> black must play
            <span class="chess-move">1. ... Nf5</span> right away
            (<span class="chess-move">1. ... Qe7?</span> isn't good enough anymore as white now
            has <span class="chess-move">2. Re1</span> to attack the queen. For example,
            <span class="chess-move">2. ... Qd8 3. Ba1!!</span> (makes room on the long diagonal
            for the queen) <span class="chess-move">3. ... Nf5</span>
            (<span class="chess-move">3. ... Nd6</span>
            <span class="chess-move">4. Qb2! Nde8</span>
            <span class="chess-move">5. h3</span> (threatens Rxe8)
            and black has to sacrifice the knight with <span class="chess-move">5. ... Nf6</span>.)
            <span class="chess-move">4. g4 Nfd4</span>
            <span class="chess-move">5. Re4</span> attacking the knight three times and black has
            to give up the piece (for example if <span class="chess-move">5. ... Ne6??</span>
            <span class="chess-move">6. Rxe6! Nc7</span> <span class="chess-move">7. Re1</span>).
            <span class="chess-move">2. g4 Qe7!</span>
            <span class="chess-move">3. Re1</span> (<span class="chess-move">3. gxf5?? Qe4+</span>
            <span class="chess-move">4. Qg2 Qxc4</span> and black should be winning having two
            extra pawns) <span class="chess-move">3. ... Qh4!=</span> because white is forced to
            exchange queens or black is better (according to the engine).</p>
