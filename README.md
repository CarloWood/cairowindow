# cairowindow submodule

This repository is a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
providing C++ classes for larger projects, including (all in namespace cairowindow):

* ``Window`` : A new native window, assuming you are on X11. Full support for tripple buffering to allow seamless, non-stop updating.
* ``Layer`` : Abstraction of a layer. Represents a drawing surface, can be smaller than and have an offset relative to the Window.
* ``LayerRegion`` : A rectangular portion of a layer that has a `draw` function associated with it (base class to all drawable objects).
* ``MultiRegion`` : Convenience base class for drawable objects that exist of more than one layer region.
* ``EventLoop`` : Returned by Window::run(). Causes the window to be opened and everything that was added to it to be drawn. Destructing the returned `EventLoop` blocks until the window was closed. You want to destroy the `EventLoop` before destroying any of the above objects, because destroying those will make them disappear (no longer being drawn).

* ``Vector`` : An x and y coordinate.
* ``Matrix`` : A row-major 2x2 matrix.
* ``Color`` : A color object.
* ``StrokeExtents`` : A rectangle object, used to keep track of what area needs to be redrawn for a given `LayerRegion` upon expose.
* ``IntersectRectangle`` : Another rectangle object, most suitable to find intersections between rectangles.

And the following "mathematical" objects that can be used to construct plottable counter parts from:

* ``Arc`` : A center point, begin and end angle, and a radius.
* ``Circle`` : A center and a radius.
* ``Connector`` : A LinePiece and two arrow head types (among which 'no_arrow').
* ``Direction`` : A direction (unit) vector.
* ``Line`` : Defined by a Point and a Direction (yes, the line has a direction "awareness").
* ``LinePiece`` : Defined by two Point's (from and to).
* ``Point`` : Defined by an x and y coordinate (double).
* ``Rectangle`` : Describes a rectangle with an (optional) offset relative to the main Window.
* ``Text`` : A Point and a std::string.

In namespace `cairowindow::plot` we currently have:

* ``Plot`` : An object representing a plot chart with title, axes, data points etc.
* ``Range`` : Describes the minimum and maximum values of the axes of a plot.

The following classes in namespace `cairowindow::plot` are derived from the classes with the same
name in namespace `cairowindow` but add a `shared_ptr` to a `draw::` object with the same name, that
contain plot specific data. Objects of these types therefore correspond with an object drawn in the
plot and destructing the object will erase it from the plot.

* ``Point`` : Created with `Plot::create_point` from a `cairowindow::Point` and a `draw::PointStyle`.
* ``Circle`` : Created with `Plot::create_circle` from a `cairowindow::Point center`, `double radius` and `draw::CircleStyle` (or `draw::LineStyle`).
* ``Text`` : Created with `Plot::create_text` from a `cairowindow::Point position`, `std::string` and `draw::TextStyle<>`.
* ``LinePiece`` : Created with `Plot::create_line` from two `cairowindow::Point` objects and `draw::LineStyle` (plus a `LineExtend` enum that allows to extend the line in zero, one or both directions).
* ``Line`` : Created with `Plot::create_line` from a `cairowindow::Point`, cairowindow::Direction` and `draw::LineStyle`.
* ``Connector`` : Created with `Plot::create_connector` from two `cairowindow::Point` objects, zero or more `Connector::ArrowHeadShape`, `draw::LineStyle` and a fill `Color` (for the arrow heads, if appropriate).
* ``Arc`` : Created with `Plot::create_arc` from a `cairowindow::Point center`, `double start_angle`, `double end_angle`, `double radius` and `draw::ArcStyle`.

The objects in namespace `cairowindow::draw` shouldn't be used by the user.
It currently contains:

* ``Arc`` : A piece of a circle.
* ``Circle`` : A circle (or ellipse).
* ``Connector`` : A line piece with optional arrow heads (open, closed, diamond or circle).
* ``Line`` : A line.
* ``Rectangle`` : A rectangle.
* ``Text`` : Some text or label.
* ``PlotArea`` : The axes and ticks of a plot.

The root project should be using
[cmake](https://cmake.org/overview/)
[cwm4](https://github.com/CarloWood/cwm4) and
[cwds](https://github.com/CarloWood/cwds).

## Checking out a project that uses the cairowindow submodule.

To clone a project example-project that uses cairowindow simply run:

    git clone --recursive <URL-to-project>/example-project.git
    cd example-project
    AUTOGEN_CMAKE_ONLY=1 ./autogen.sh

The ``--recursive`` is optional because ``./autogen.sh`` will fix
it when you forgot it.

In order to use ``cmake`` configure as usual, for example to do a debug build with 16 cores:

    mkdir build_debug
    cmake -S . -B build_debug -DCMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON -DEnableDebugGlobal:BOOL=OFF
    cmake --build build_debug --config Debug --parallel 16

Or to make a release build:

    mkdir build_release
    cmake -S . -B build_release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build_release --config Release --parallel 16

## Adding the cairowindow submodule to a project

To add this submodule to a project, that project should already
be set up to use [cwm4](https://github.com/CarloWood/cwm4).

Simply execute the following in a directory of that project
where you want to have the ``cairowindow`` subdirectory (the
root of the project is recommended as that is the only thing
I've tested so far):

    git submodule add https://github.com/CarloWood/cairowindow.git

This should clone cairowindow into the subdirectory ``cairowindow``, or
if you already cloned it there, it should add it.

### Using cmake

Check out the submodules [cwds](https://github.com/CarloWood/cwds), [cwm4](https://github.com/CarloWood/cwm4)
and [ai-utils](https://github.com/CarloWood/ai-utils) in the root of the project:

    git submodule add https://github.com/CarloWood/cwds.git
    git submodule add https://github.com/CarloWood/cwm4.git
    git submodule add https://github.com/CarloWood/ai-utils.git utils

The easiest way to use libcwd is by using [gitache](https://github.com/CarloWood/gitache).

For that to happen create in the root of the project (that uses utils)
a directory ``cmake/gitache-configs`` and put in it the file ``libcwd_r.cmake``
with the content:

    gitache_config(
      GIT_REPOSITORY
        "https://github.com/CarloWood/libcwd.git"
      GIT_TAG
        "master"
      CMAKE_ARGS
        "-DEnableLibcwdAlloc:BOOL=OFF -DEnableLibcwdLocation:BOOL=ON"
    )

Add the variable ``GITACHE_ROOT`` to your environment,
for example add to your ``~/.bashrc`` the line:

    export GITACHE_ROOT="/opt/gitache"

Add the following lines to the ``CMakeLists.txt`` in the
root of the project (directly under the ``project`` line):

    # Begin of gitache configuration.
    set(GITACHE_PACKAGES libcwd_r)
    include(cwm4/cmake/StableGitache)
    # End of gitache configuration.

    include(cwm4/cmake/AICxxProject)
    include(AICxxSubmodules)

``add_subdirectory`` is not necessary for ``cwds``, ``cwm4``, ``utils`` or ``cairowindow``.

See for example the root [MakeLists.txt](https://github.com/CarloWood/machine-learning/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) of machine-learning.

Finally, linking is done by adding ``${AICXX_OBJECTS_LIST}`` to
the appropriate ``target_link_libraries``.

For example,

    include(AICxxProject)

    add_executable(register_test register_test.cxx)
    target_link_libraries(register_test PRIVATE ${AICXX_OBJECTS_LIST})

See this [MakeLists.txt](https://github.com/CarloWood/machine-learning/blob/master/src/CMakeLists.txt)
of machine-learning for a complete example.

Finally, run

    ./autogen.sh

to let cwm4 do its magic, and commit all the changes.

Checkout [machine-learning](https://github.com/CarloWood/machine-learning)
for an example of a project that uses this submodule.
